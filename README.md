# Maestro.ai
This is a lackadaisical project to prompt AI into creating it's version of the best client-side JS framework based on my biased prompts. 
I'll be commiting the repo per prompt, so you can watch as it develops. 

*Author's note. This will either be a giant turd or the greatest framework on the planet. There are no in betweens.
